xboxdrv is a Xbox/Xbox360 gamepad driver for Linux that works in userspace.
 It is an alternative to the xpad kernel driver and has support for Xbox1 gamepads, 
Xbox360 USB gamepads and Xbox360 wireless gamepads. The Xbox360 guitar and some Xbox1 dancemats might work too. 
The Xbox 360 racing wheel is not supported, but shouldn't be to hard to add if somebody is interested.
