# Digital Speech Decoder - Florida Man Edition

This version of DSD is a flavor blend of [szechyjs](https://github.com/szechyjs/dsd "szechyjs") RTL branch and some of my own additions, along with portions of DMR and NXDN code from the [LouisErigHerve](https://github.com/LouisErigHerve/dsd "LouisErigHerve") branch. This code also borrows snippets, inspiration, and ideas from other open source works including [Boatbod OP25](https://github.com/boatbod/op25 "Boatbod OP25"), [DSDcc](https://github.com/f4exb/dsdcc "DSDcc"), [SDTRunk](https://github.com/DSheirer/sdrtrunk "SDRTrunk"), [MMDVMHost](https://github.com/g4klx/MMDVMHost "MMDVMHost"), [LFSR](https://github.com/mattames/LFSR "LFSR"), and [EZPWD-Reed-Solomon](https://github.com/pjkundert/ezpwd-reed-solomon "EZPWD"). This project wouldn't be possible without a few good people providing me plenty of sample audio files to run over and over again. Special thanks to jurek1111, KrisMar, noamlivne, racingfan360, iScottyBotty, LimaZulu and hrh17 for the many hours of wav samples submitted by them.
