Contra[a] is a video game series produced by Konami composed primarily of run and gun-style shooting games. 
The series debuted in February 1987 with the Japanese coin-operated arcade game of the same name, which has
 since spawned several sequels produced for various platforms.
The arcade version of Contra was released a few months after the Iran–Contra affair was made public.
 While it is unclear whether the game was deliberately named after the Nicaraguan Contra rebels, the 
ending theme of the original game was titled "Sandinista"
 (サンディニスタ, Sandinisuta), after the adversaries of the real-life Contras.[1]
