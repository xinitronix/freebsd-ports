Essentially this repo is a 'project' to replicate the XP experience on XFCE / Linux in general. This includes everything from desktop themes, icons, cursors, all the way to programs and the shell itself.

Please be aware of the following:

    This project is NOT for installing on your parents/grandparents/whoever's computer to 'ease them into Linux' or something, I share this project for the interest of Windows/Linux enthusiasts
    There is no attempt to pretend the system is not Linux - consider this as 'Windows XP on the Linux kernel' (ie. you cannot expect there to be a C: drive under My Computer)
    Everything is massively under construction, and I am one person, so please don't whinge to me about how x/y/z doesn't look 100% like Windows XP, or that I haven't made program a/b/c
