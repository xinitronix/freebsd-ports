Joint Operations: Typhoon Rising is a 2004 first-person shooter computer game from Novalogic that focuses
 almost entirely on its expansive online multiplayer mode. Set in Indonesia in the near future, Joint Operations 
takes the player to a country on the verge of disintegration. Regional independence movements have acquired advanced
 weaponry as the nation's military splits into competing factions. Escalating violence threatens innocent civilians 
and Western economic interests. Developed using the Black Hawk Down engine, Joint Operations promises superior rendering
 technology and an enhanced 3rd generation multiplayer experience.
