NASCAR Racing 2003 Season, or NR2003 for short, is a computer racing simulator released in February 2003 by Papyrus 
Design Group for Windows and Mac OS X. The game was the last to be released by the company before EA Sports bought 
the NASCAR license exclusively from 2004 to 2009 (parent company Sierra's successor company, Activision Blizzard, 
reacquired NASCAR rights in 2011, with NASCAR The Game: 2011). The game included all of the 2003 NASCAR season tracks 
and many of the drivers, including Dave Blaney, who was absent in NASCAR Thunder 2004. 
In May 2003, Papyrus published a free DLC for the game, containing three fictional tracks.[4]
