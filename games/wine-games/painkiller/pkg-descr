Painkiller is a first-person shooter video game developed by Polish game studio People Can Fly and published 
by DreamCatcher Interactive in April 2004 for Microsoft Windows and ported to Xbox in 2006. The game's single 
player campaign follows a dead man in Purgatory who is offered a deal to defeat the invading forces of Lucifer's
 army in exchange for being allowed to enter Heaven. The game was particularly well-received for its 
multiplayer experience and was featured for two seasons on the Cyberathlete Professional League's World Tour.
