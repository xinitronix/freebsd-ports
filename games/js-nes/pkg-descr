Jungle Strike[c] is a video game developed and published by Electronic Arts in 1993 for the Sega Genesis. 
The game was later released on several other consoles such as the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), 
and an upgraded version was made for DOS computers. The Amiga conversion was the responsibility of Ocean Software
 while the SNES and PC DOS versions were that of Gremlin Interactive, and the portable console versions were of Black 
Pearl Software. It is the direct sequel to Desert Strike (a best-seller released the previous year) and is the second 
installment in the Strike series. The game is a helicopter-based shoot 'em up, mixing action and strategy. 
The plot concerns two villains intent on destroying Washington, D.C.
 The player must use the helicopter and occasionally other vehicles to thwart their plans.
