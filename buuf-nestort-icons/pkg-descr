Buuf For Many Desktops icon set (formerly known as "Buuf Nestort", I've decided to remove my alias from the theme's name.
This is a fairly complete set of icons for Gnome, KDE Plasma, XFCE and Mate (including actions, apps, categories, devices, emblems, emotes, 
mimetypes, places and status), based on the icons and artwork by Paul Davey (Mattahan) (http://www.mattahan.com/). 
Some of them come from OxayotlTheGreat and his great job with his own remix, Buuf https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1012512), and some others, from https://github.com/robson-66/Buuf. 
They have done a great job expanding the "Buuf Universe".
